# ColorPalette
Website that allows Users to upload an image and get the dominant colors used in it as RGB code

I used Numpy to process the image data. I am well aware, that there are existing tools like the extcolors library or the colorthief module.
However I decided to go the long way to fully understand image processing with Numpy and the use of 3D arrays to represent image data.
Processing the data with np.unique(data, axis=0, return_counts=True) and only taking the highest count, leads to color palette with very similar colors, 
I used the scikitlearn KMeans-clustering method to group similar colors together.

It's not perfect, but I understand ndarrays and their use for image processing a lot better know.

## What I learned / used for the first time:
### HTML / CSS:
- Uploading an image file on a website with HTML-tags form and input
- Creating a dropdown menu for User Input with the help of HTML-tags form and select
- Using CSS inline-style to pass over variables from Python Code (RGB colors)
  
### Python
- Checking the image file for the right file format
- Using Werkzeug Utilities to create a secure filename before saving the image file
- Processing images with the Pillow library, including resizing an image
  
### Numpy
- Turning an image into numpy 3D-array and how they represent RGB image data
- Reshaping a numpy ndarray
- Finding unique values and their counts in a numpy 2D-array
- Turning numpy 2D-arrays into a list
- Grouping similar arrays using scikitlearn KMeans-clustering
